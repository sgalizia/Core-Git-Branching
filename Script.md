## Plot

Raptor Jesus woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After his typical breakfast of toast and an egg he left for school.
Normally Raptor Jesus would have walked down Bleaker streat, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of Raptor Jesus’s specialities today would prove to be no different.
As he moved slowly.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
Raptor Jesus had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally Raptor Jesus would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse, he called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

Raptor Jesus finds the Unicorn King who tells him of his captor, the Zookeeper. The Unicorn King says he will give Raptor Jesus magical powers if he can help him escape from the terrible Zookeeper.

Raptor Jesus agrees to help the Unicorn King. The Unicorn King, keeping his promise, grants Raptor Jesus magical powers that allow him to hunt with compelete stealth.

Raptor Jesus uses his new stealth powers to track down the Zookeeper in the food court. Raptor Jesus whips out his laser sword and challenges the Zookeeper, Darth Reptilius, to a fight to the death. A crazy battle ensues destroying most of the food court in the process.

At last Raptor Jesus strikes the death blow, defeating Darth Reptilius. Raptor Jesus returns to the Unicorn King and sets him free. In a twist of fate, the Unicorn King runs Raptor Jesus through with his horn.

In shock and disbelief, Raptor Jesus collapses on the ground, his lifeblood draining as the Unicorn King starts to change shape. With a bellowing evil laugh, the Unicorn King shifts into the shape of Lord Monochrome.

The end.
